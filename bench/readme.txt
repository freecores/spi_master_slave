spi_master_slave simulation testbench
=====================================

This is the basic simulation testbench file for the spi_master.vhd and spi_slave.vhd.
The simulation environment used for the development was Xilinx ISIM from the ISE 13.1 webpack.

The .wcfg file is the ISIM waveform configuration file, with all the buses already configured for 
hexadecimal number format and signal groupings that make sense.
